# node_passport_login


This repo is designed for assisting us with a simple login and register page

The config directory consists of keys.js wherein you could give the mongodb connection uri.

When a user registers all of his info gets stored in the db.

The login page uses passport to authenticate and also maintain the cookie so that user can access the dashboard only through

login.
